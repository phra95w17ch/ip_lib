# ip_lib
Python IP Validation and Function library

A simple Python library to use to vaildate IP addresses and, in the future perhaps, preform other basic functions to IP addresses.

The original.py file, written by yours truly, contains the original code used to creat the ip_valid.py funntion. I have included the original code so you can see how @lojikil took my code, optimized it and wrapped it into a function. 

Hopefully this small project will help in two ways; one, that the ip_valid.py lib will be useful to developers, so they don't have to spend time writing validation code, and two, to help people just learning Python see how to optimize code and create a function.

Comments, ideas and code are welcomed and encouraged!
